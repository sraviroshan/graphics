NOTE:
Consider a simple, large rectangular polygon.  Lighting will only
be evaluated at the four corners and if your spotlight points at
the center you probably won't see any hint of a spotlight effect.
If you tessellate the polygon into many small polygons then lighting
will be sampled more frequently and you'll see the spotlight effect.

That's why spotlight was working when pointed at corners of wall and not when
pointed at center
